        <h2> I am Ritankar Naha</h2>
        <p> I am from Kolkata, West Bengal, India. I am learning coding at 'Whitehat jr' and I am quite excited to have completed my game development course and now have made a step forward to app development. The games in the other pages are some of them that I have made during this course. I hope you all will like them. Thank you for playing my games...</p>
